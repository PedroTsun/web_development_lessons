# Lesson 02: Programming Environment

## Context
* **Course:** Web Development
* **Main Objective:** Introduce students to at least one programming environment

## Warmup
How do you normally type a computer program into your computer?

## Mini-lesson: **Programming Environment**

### Explain:

* Microsoft Expression Web was used to make web pages, but it is no longer supported
* Adobe offers webpage building tools for a monthly subscription fee
* Weebly and Wix and squarespace charge people for using their website builder tools and services 
* In contrast, using replit is free and easy
* Also, code.cs50.io is free in conjunction with github.io
* git-scm allows you to communicate between your computer and repository server like github
* bitbucket and gitlab are also free, but charge for a nominal fee for maintaining code ownership

---

### Demo:

* Show how to use replit to build a website in no time.
* Show how to use git/bash to build a website using github
* show how to use code.cs50.io to build a website with github
* Also show how to just use Visual Studio code to build a local webpage for testing
* Introduce famous editors like vi, emacs
* Mention editors like sublime, notepad++, nano/pico, **codespaces** and gedit

## Practice:
Have students try at least replit.com to push out a simple webpage.  
If possible, have students build a website using code.cs50.io.  
Finally, students can try git/bash to see how they can host webpages locally and remotely.
